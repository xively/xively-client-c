  42 Aggregated Software
  43 
  44 In addition to MINIX 3 itself, the distribution CD-ROM and this Website
  45 contain additional software that is not part of MINIX 3 and is not
  46 covered by this license. The licensing conditions for this additional
  47 software are stated in the various packages. In particular, some of the
  48 additional software falls under the GPL, and you must take care to
  49 observe the conditions of the GPL with respect to this software. As
  50 clearly stated in Article 2 of the GPL, when GPL and nonGPL software are
  51 distributed together on the same medium, this aggregation does not cause
  52 the license of either part to apply to the other part.
