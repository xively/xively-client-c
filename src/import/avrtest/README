What is avrtest?
================

avrtest is a free software simulator for the Atmel AVR family of
microcontrollers distributed under the GNU General Public License.

The main intention of avrtest is to supply a fast, easy-to-use simulator
to run the GCC testsuite for avr-gcc.  Thus, its main audience are guys
that develop parts of the AVR toolchain like avr-gcc or avr-libc.

avrtest is an instruction set simulator for AVR core families
   avr51: ATmega128*, AT90can128, AT90usb128*
   avr6:  ATmega256*

avrtest-xmega is an instruction set simulator for AVR XMEGA core families
   avrxmega6: ATXmega128*, ...

The exectuable that supports AVR XMEGA cores is named avrtest-xmega.
In addition to the avrtest simulator, it supports the XMEGA instructions
XCH, LAS, LAC and LAT.

In the remainder, avrtest is explained.  avrtest-xmega works similar.
avrtest does not simulate internal peripherals like timers, I/O ports,
interrupts, etc. 

================
Special features
================

The simulator has builtin capability of writing to stdout when a value
is written to a destinct memory location.  For example, an easy hello world
program for AVR could look like this:


#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    printf ("Hallo World!\n");
    return 0;
}


Compile this program as usual but link against exit-atmega128.o. 
How to build that object is explained in the next chapter. Store the
C source as hello.c and compile it with, e.g.

	avr-gcc hello.c -O -mmcu=atmega128 -o hello.elf /someplace/avrtest/exit-atmega128.o

The exit-*.o object arranges the putchar function to write to the mentioned
location.  avrtest will pick the value and print it to standard output of your
host computer.  To start the program, type

	avrtest -mmcu=avr51 hello.elf

This will print something like


Hallo World!

 exit status: EXIT
      reason: exit function called
     program: hello.elf
exit address: 00011c
total cycles: 806


You can also write to the magic locations directly:


#include "avrtest.h"

int main (void)
{
    char c;
    
    STDOUT_PORT = 'Q';

    c = STDIN_PORT;
    STDOUT_PORT = c+1;
    
    return 0;
}


avrtest.h defines the port locations. Compile the C source with

	avr-gcc inout.c -O -mmcu=atmega128 -o inout.elf -I /someplace/avrtest

When running the program with

	avrtest -mmcu=avr51 inout.elf

The simulator will print a 'Q' on the console and wait for input. 
Type '1<Enter>' and the output will be

Q1
2
 exit status: EXIT
      reason: infinite loop detected (normal exit)
     program: inout.elf
exit address: 0000b8
total cycles: 30


There are two more magic ports besides STDIN_PORT and STDOUT_PORT:
Try writing to ABORT_PORT resp. EXIT_PORT.

Running avr-gcc testsuite using avrtest simulator
=================================================

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/avr-gcc-list/2009-09/msg00016.html

* Get avr-gcc, binutils and avr-libc built from sources and working.

* Install dejagnu, expect and TCL

* Unpack the avrtest tar file from WinAVR sources top "someplace".
  You find a link to the package at "Download GNU tarball" on
  http://winavr.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/winavr/trunk/avrtest/?view=tar

* Run

	make
  
  inside /someplace/avrtest which will build executables from avrtest.c
  and avr object file exit-atmega128.o from dejagnuboards/exit.c.

* To build the XMEGA simulator and exit-atxmega128a3.o, run

	make all-xmega

* To build exit*.o modules, avr-gcc will be used.  If you want a different
  avr-gcc not found in PATH, use (alternatively with all-xmega):
  
	make clean-exit all AVRGCC=/some-compiler-path/avr-gcc

* Copy /someplace/avrtest/.dejagnurc to your $HOME and change the path
  inside to point to directory where "board file" is located.
  This is dejagnuboards subdirectory of avrtest files:

	set board dir /someplace/avrtest/dejagnuboards

* Edit /someplace/avrtest/dejagnuboards/atmega128-sim.exp and replace paths
  to point to correct location of files for simulator (avrtest executable
  and exit-atmega128.o object file) or add avrtest to $PATH:

	set result [exec /someplace/avrtest/avrtest -m 2000000000 -no-stdin $prog ]

	set board_info ldflags "/someplace/avrtest/exit-atmega128.o" -Wl,-u,vfprintf ...

* Run the tests from gcc subdirectory of your avr-gcc build directory like:

	make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim"
	make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atxmega128-sim"

* Look in the ./gcc/testsuite subdirectory of avr-gcc build directory
  for logged results or you can add -all switch to
  see it working 1 test at a time.

	make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim -all"

* You can run parts of the testsuite like this:

	make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim avr.exp"
	make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim avr-torture.exp=pr418854.c"

Voila!
