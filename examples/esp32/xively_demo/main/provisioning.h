 * @brief Runtime provisioning implementation - Used to handle the UI to interact
 * with the user to gather all required credentials.
 * @detailed In this demo, runtime provisioning is done over UART. You may replace
 * this implementation with, for instance, start the device as an AP when provisioning
 * is required and implement a webserver on the device so the user can set their
 * credentials from the browser via HTTP.
 * For demos, the Xively credentials are provisioned the same way as WiFi creds,
 * but in a production environment you'd use different methods- Ideally, flashing
 * the credentials in the factory
