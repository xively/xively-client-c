 * @brief Interface between the top level application logic and the Xively Client
 * Library for an RTOS-based environment.
 *
 * \mainpage Sample Implementation of a Dedicated RTOS Task for the Xively Client
 * Library
 *
 * @detailed Xively Task is a state machine that will run on its own RTOS task,
 * and a task-safe API to communicate with it, request the task to pause/shutdown
 * when other parts of the application need extra resources, etc.
 *
 * Most, if not all of the Xively Client logic is run from within this task, so
 * this demo can be used to measure the stack requirements of the library.
 *
 * For some production systems, you may want/need to implement a limit on how many
 * subscribe/publish messages are in flight at any given point; not sending the
 * next publish/subscribe message until the callback for the previous one(s)
 * have acknowledged success.
 * This will help make sure the Xively Client doesn't internally allocate too
 * much memory (required for QoS>0)  and crash your device. This can be done by
 * adding a new _PUBSUB request and machine state that only publishes the next
 * item in a queue when ready, and rejects messages when the queue is full.
