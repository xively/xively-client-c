Example Project Status
======================

This example is broken for the latest version of the Cube SDK. It was proven
working with version `STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.14.0`, but broke at
`STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.16.0`

We don't plan on maintaining the example for every SDK release. We're not
removing it either, in case it's useful to developers looking to use this
platform.

You should expect a significant amount of work to get it working. An SDK update
to v1.16.0 was implemented for the stm32f4_ethernet example in
[this pull request](https://github.com/xively/xively-client-c/pull/122).
