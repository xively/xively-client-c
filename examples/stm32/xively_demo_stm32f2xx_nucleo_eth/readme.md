Example Project Status
======================

This example is broken for the latest version of the Cube SDK. It was proven
working with version `STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.14.0`, but broke at
`STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.16.0`

We don't plan on maintaining the example for every SDK release. We're not
removing it either, in case it's useful to developers looking to use this
platform.

An SDK update to v1.16.0 was implemented for the stm32f4_ethernet example in
[this pull request](https://github.com/xively/xively-client-c/pull/122).
