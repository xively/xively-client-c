@par Application Description 

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run a http server application 
based on Netconn API of LwIP TCP/IP stack
The communication is done with a web browser application in a remote PC.

this HTTP server contains two html pages:
  + the first page (home page) is static, it gives information about STM32F4
    and LwIP stack.
  + the second page is dynamically refreshed (every 1 s), it shows the RTOS 
    statistics in runtime

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define USE_DHCP in main.h)

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the System tick interrupt 
to configure the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be 
set lower (numerically greater) than the Systick interrupt priority to ensure 
that the System tick increments while executing the Ethernet Link ISR.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct 
      HAL operation.
      
For more details about this application, refer to UM1713 "STM32Cube interfacing with LwIP and applications"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F429xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - NUCLEO-F429ZI Rev.B board
     - Http clients: Firefox Mozilla (v24) or Microsoft Internet Explorer (v8 and later)
     - DHCP server:  PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server    
      
  - NUCLEO-F429ZI Set-up
    - Connect the nucleo board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
  
  - Remote PC Set-up
    - Configure a static IP address for your remote PC 
      for example 192.168.0.11 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Check that nucleo board is connected to a remote PC before running the application
 - Run the application
