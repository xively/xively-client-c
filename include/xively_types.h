/**
 * @name  xi_sft_url_handler_callback_t
 * @brief application entry point type for HTTP download of update package files
 *
 * The application must define and pass a pointer to a function with this signature only
 * if Secure File Update (SFT) package contains files too large to download over MQTT.
 * This function is called with each and every file in the update package (*even for MQTT
 * provided ones!*) and responsible to start a file download and then report the result
 * back to Xively C Client.
 * The function may reject the HTTP download, in such case the Xively C Client
 * tries to fallback to MQTT download. This is independently true for each and every
 * file in the update package. The HTTP or MQTT file download way is indifferent
 * from the update process point of view.
 * Please see the POSIX example for SFT with HTTP download in
 * `examples/firmware_update/src/firmware_update.c`
 *
 * This function should return immediately and NOT block. The download process should
 * take place on a separate thread spawned by the application. But the callback
 * (`fn_on_file_downloaded_callback`) to the Xively C Client should be called on the
 * Client's thread and NOT on the download thread.
 * A task might be scheduled to poll download status with API function:
 * `xi_schedule_timed_task`.
 *
 * Or on low resource devices *advanced developers* can solve the download
 * on the Xively C Client's thread downloading the file in chunks with non-blocking
 * socket and with the help of Xively C Client's scheduled task through the
 * `xi_schedule_timed_task` *API function. In this case the download task should
 * comply to the cooperative multitasking principle: return in a very short
 * period of time.
 *
 * @param [in] url the file can be downloaded from this URL
 * @param [in] filename the the downloaded file must be saved with this filename onto the
 *                      device's non-volatile storage
 * @param [in] checksum the checksum of the file set in CPM. The application
 *                      is responsible to validate the checksum. To do this one may use
 *                      the functions in `xi_bsp_fwu.h:xi_bsp_fwu_checksum_*`.
 * @param [in] checksum_len the number of bytes the checksum consists of
 * @param [in] flag_mqtt_download_available 1 - if internal MQTT download fallback is
 *                                              available and will happen if this
 *                                              function fails the download
 *                                          0 - if MQTT download isn't available at all
 * @param [in] fn_on_file_downloaded_callback pointer to a Xively C Client callback. The
 *                                            application has to call this function after
 *                                            download finishes.
 * @param [in] callback_data a pointer required to be passed back to the
 *                           `fn_on_file_downloaded_callback`. The application
 *                           shouldn't do anything with this data pointer, just pass
 *                           back to the callback.
 *
 * @retval 1 - if HTTP download is started by the application
 * @retval 0 - if HTTP download is rejectedby the application. If
 *             `flag_mqtt_download_available` is `1` the Xively C Client will
 *             fall back to MQTT download through the SFT service.
