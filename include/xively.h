 * @brief The main API for compiling your Application against the
 * the xively library.
 *
 * \mainpage Xively Client for C
 *
 * # Welcome
 * The functions of the main Xively API are used to build a client
 * connection to the Xively Service over a secure socket, and
 * publish / subscribe to messages over MQTT.
 * This documention, in conjuction with the Xively C Client User Guide
 * (<code>/doc/user_guide.md</code>) and source examples in
 * <code>/examples/</code>, should provide
 * you with enough information to create your custom
 * Xively-enabled applications.
 *
 * If you're looking for information on how to port the Xively C
 * Client to your custom embedded device, then please instead direct
 * your attention to the Board Support Package documentation.  This
 * exists in two parts, the Xively C Client Porting Guide
 * (<code>/doc/porting_guide.md</code>) and the
 * <a href="../../bsp/html/index.html">BSP doxygen</a>.
 *
 * # Where to Start
 * All of the standard Xively Client API functions are contained within
 * the <code>/include</code> directory of the project's base path, and have the
 * 'xively' prefix. We suggest clicking on xively.h in the doxygen
 * File tab to get started.
 *
 * For most POSIX systems this might be all of the documentation that
 * you need. However, if you're building a library to be exeucted on your
 * own custom platform with non POSIX library support, then you may also
 * need to browse the Board Support Package (BSP) functions as well.
 * These functions are documented in the BSP doxygen documentation that's
 * contained in a sibling directory as this doxygen.
