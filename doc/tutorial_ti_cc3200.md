# Tutorial for Xively C Client on Texas Instruments CC3200


Welcome to the Xively C Client build tutorial for the TI CC3200!

Here you will learn how to build, link, and deploy a Xively C Client to this embedded platform using the Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE from Texas Instruments.

This tutorial supports OSX and Windows, though the Linux flow should be somewhat similar.

## Platform Software Installation

TI's CC3200 requires to main software package installations to use their standard SDK.

### TI Code Composer Studio
Code Composer Studio includes the toolchain (compiler) you'll need to build for the CC3200 and a java-based IDE.
Download [TI Code Composer Studio](http://www.ti.com/tool/ccstudio) and start installation process.

1. Accept the license agreement and click ```Next >```.
2. Choose the default install folder and click ```Next >```. Or, if you install into a custom directory, then please note its path as you will need to refer to it later.

	By default the path should be ```c:\ti``` on Windows and ```/Applications/ti``` on MacOS.

3. Enable the following two options under ```SimpleLink Wireless MCUs```:
	1. ```CC3200xx Device Support```
	2. ```TI ARM Compiler```

4. Click ```Next >``` twice more, and click ```Finish``` when the button becomes enabled.
5. Once installation completes, click ```Finish``` to leave the installer.

### CC3200 Simplelink WiFi SDK
These are the platform libraries that you'll need to compile and link against when writing software for the CC3200.

1. Launch Code Composer Studio.
2. If prompted to ```Select a Workspace```, click ```OK``` to select the default path.
3. 	Select  ```View```->```Resource Explorer``` from the top bar menu.
4. Select ```CC3200 Simplelink WiFi``` from the list of available development tools.
5. On the right side of the screen, click the ```Install on Desktop``` down-arrow icon and select ```Make Available Offline```. Confirm ```Yes``` on the popup window.
6. A ```Dependencies``` popup may appear.  Click ```OK``` to download any software dependencies.

*NOTE*: Windows users may download the SDK directly outside of CCS if you wish:

- download [CC3200 Simplelink WiFi SDK](http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3200sdk) and install using default settings.

## Building the Xively C Client library

### Download the xively-client-c library source
1. Download the library source code from [xively-client-c](https://github.com/xively/xively-client-c).  You use [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) to clone the repository or download the source archive on the right side of the page.


### Prebuild Configuration of the Xively C Client

#### Configure Make Target file mt-cc3200
1. Open the file ```make/mt-os/mt-cc3200``` in your favorite friendly text editor.
2. Scroll the HOSTS section devoted to your host platform: ```MAC HOST OS```, ```WINDOWS HOST OS```, or ```LINUX HOST OS```.
2. In your newly identified host's section, set ```XI_CC3200_PATH_CCS_TOOLS``` and ```XI_CC3200_PATH_SDK``` to your Code Composer Studio and SDK install paths, respectively.  If chose the default installation paths for these installations then these values should already be valid.
3. The toolchain that Code Composer Studio downloaded might differ from the default that's configured in this ```mt-c3200``` file.
	1. Please browse to the path which you set ```XI_CC3200_PATH_CCS_TOOLS```.
	2. Open up the ```compiler/``` and note the the name of the toolchain.
	3. Compare this to the toolchain name stored in the ```COMPILER``` variable near the top of the file in ```mt-cc3200```.  Update the ```COMPILER``` variable as necessary.

### Build Xively C Client library

The process for building slightly depends on your host OS:

- Windows:

    Set paths for ```gmake``` and ```mkdir```

        PATH=%PATH%;c:\ti\ccsv6\utils\bin
        PATH=%PATH%;c:\ti\ccsv6\utils\cygwin

    Clean and build the library:

        gmake PRESET=CC3200_REL_MIN clean
        gmake PRESET=CC3200_REL_MIN

- MacOS and Linux:

    Clean and build the library:

        make PRESET=CC3200_REL_MIN clean
        make PRESET=CC3200_REL_MIN

For all host platforms the PRESET=CC3200_REL_MIN_UNSECURE results in a Xively C Client version without a secure TLS connection. This can be useful for development purposes against local MQTT brokers, like [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) but is not advised for devices in a real production enviorment.

## Building the wolfSSL library

WolfSSL is used to create secure TLS connections.  There is a version of WolfSSL provided on-chip when using the CC3200, but it does not provide OCSP support. OCSP support is crucial in detecting compromised and revoked Certficates, and therefore we have provided instructions on building and linking against a newer version of the WolfSSL library so that OCSP can be leveraged by your project.

### Download WolfSSL library source
- Download WolfSSL library source code from [wolfssl](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v3.9.6)
- Put the WolfSSL main directory under the PATH_TO_XIVELY_LIBRARY_MAIN_FOLDER/xively-client-c/src/import/tls/

### Configure WolfSSL library source

The wolfSSL supports TI-RTOS builds. Follow the steps written on [Using wolfSSL with TI-RTOS](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Using_wolfSSL_with_TI-RTOS) to generate wolfSSL static library for CC3200.

Example tirtos/products.mak variable settings for Windows and MacOS:

- Windows:

        XDC_INSTALL_DIR        =c:/ti/xdctools_3_32_01_22_core
        BIOS_INSTALL_DIR       =c:/ti/tirex-content/tirtos_cc32xx_2_16_00_08/products/bios_6_45_01_29
        NDK_INSTALL_DIR        =
        TIVAWARE_INSTALL_DIR   =

        export XDCTOOLS_JAVA_HOME=c:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jre1.8.0_51

        ti.targets.arm.elf.M4F =c:/ti/ccsv6/tools/compiler/arm_15.12.3.LTS
        iar.targets.arm.M4F    =
        gnu.targets.arm.M4F    =

- MacOS:

        XDC_INSTALL_DIR        =/Applications/ti/xdctools_3_32_01_22_core
        BIOS_INSTALL_DIR       =/Users/atigyi/ti/tirex-content/tirtos_cc32xx_2_16_00_08/products/bios_6_45_01_29
        NDK_INSTALL_DIR        =
        TIVAWARE_INSTALL_DIR   =

        export XDCTOOLS_JAVA_HOME=/Applications/ti/ccsv6/eclipse/jre/Contents/Home

        ti.targets.arm.elf.M4F =/Applications/ti/ccsv6/tools/compiler/arm_15.12.3.LTS
        iar.targets.arm.M4F    =
        gnu.targets.arm.M4F    =

Further wolfSSL build customizations:

- In file wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h add a new platform macro WOLFSSL_NOOS_XIVELY with content:

        #ifdef WOLFSSL_NOOS_XIVELY

        /*
         *  Wolf cypher settings
         */
        #undef   WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
        // #undef   NO_DH
        #define  NO_DH

        #define  NO_DES
        #define  NO_DES3
        #define  NO_DSA
        #define  NO_HC128
        #define  NO_MD4
        #define  NO_OLD_TLS
        #define  NO_PSK
        #define  NO_PWDBASED
        #define  NO_RC4
        #define  NO_RABBIT
        #define  NO_SHA512

        #define SINGLE_THREADED

        #define CUSTOM_RAND_GENERATE xively_ssl_rand_generate

        #define HAVE_SNI
        #define HAVE_OCSP
        #define HAVE_CERTIFICATE_STATUS_REQUEST

        #define SMALL_SESSION_CACHE
        #define NO_CLIENT_CACHE
        #define WOLFSSL_SMALL_STACK
        #define WOLFSSL_USER_IO
        #define TARGET_IS_CC3200

        #define SIZEOF_LONG_LONG 8
        #define NO_WRITEV
        #define NO_WOLFSSL_DIR
        #define USE_FAST_MATH
        #define TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT
        #define NO_DEV_RANDOM
        #define NO_FILESYSTEM
        #define USE_CERT_BUFFERS_2048
        // #define NO_ERROR_STRINGS
        #define USER_TIME
        #define HAVE_ECC
        // #define HAVE_ALPN
        #define HAVE_TLS_EXTENSIONS
        #define HAVE_AESGCM
        // #define HAVE_SUPPORTED_CURVES
        #define ALT_ECC_SIZE

        #ifdef __IAR_SYSTEMS_ICC__
            #pragma diag_suppress=Pa089
        #elif !defined(__GNUC__)
            /* Suppress the sslpro warning */
            #pragma diag_suppress=11
        #endif

        #endif

    This will configure wolfSSL features needed for connecting to Xively services.

- To compile in the above settings replace the

        -DWOLFSSL_TIRTOS

    to

        -DWOLFSSL_NOOS_XIVELY

    in file `wolfssl/tirtos/wolfssl.bld`.


- In file `wolfssl/tirtos/packages/ti/net/wolfssl/package.bld` comment out the last lines for building hwLib:

        /*
        var hwLibptions = {incs: wolfsslPathInclude, defs: " -DWOLFSSL_TI_HASH "
               + "-DWOLFSSL_TI_CRYPT -DTARGET_IS_SNOWFLAKE_RA2"};

        var hwLib = Pkg.addLibrary("lib/wolfssl_tm4c_hw", targ, hwLibptions);
        hwLib.addObjects(wolfSSLObjList);
        */

    This is not available for CC3200 and not needed for a Xively C Client TLS lib.

- In file `wolfssl/tirtos/packages/ti/net/wolfssl/package.bld` to add OCSP support add "src/ocsp.c" source file to wolfSSLObjList variable.

- to build wolfSSL static library type

    - MacOS:

            make -f wolfssl.mak all

    - Windows:

            PATH=%PATH%;c:\ti\ccsv6\utils\bin
            gmake -f wolfssl.mak all

    under directory `wolfssl/tirtos. The result file is ```wolfssl/tirtos/packages/ti/net/wolfssl/lib/wolfssl.aem4f``` this is the library one should link to an example application to provide wolfSSL symbols.


## Building your CC3200 example application

We suggest the ent_wlan networking example from the CC3200 SDK as the basis for connecting to Xively. We will first import the example into Code Comoser Studio, and then add some code to build your IoT Client connection to the Xively service.

### Building the ent_wlan Example

#### Import ent_wlan
1. In Code Composer Studio, select ```File```->```Import```.
2. Select ```Code Composer Studio```->```CCS Projects``` and click ```Next >```
3. To the right of ```Select search-directory``` click Browse.
4. From this directory, browse to ```ti/tirex-content/CC3200SDK_1.1.0/cc3200-sdk/example/ent_wlan``` and highlight the ```ccs``` folder.  Click ```Open```.
5. Click ```Finish```.

#### Build and Run the Example
1. Select ```Project```-> ```Build Project```
	1. When complete, you should see in the ```Console```:

			<Linking>
			Finished building target: ent_wlan.out
			...
			**** Build Finished ****

2. Before the first execution, you will need to create a Configuration so that Code Composer Studio knows which platform you're loading the source onto.
	1. Select ```View``` -> ```Target Configurations```.  The ```Target Configurations``` panel opens to the right side of the IDE.
	2. Right click on ```User Defined``` and select ```New Target Configuration```.
	3. Choose a filename or keep the default.  Click ```Finish```.
	4. In the ```Connection``` pulldown, select ```Stellaris In-Circuit Debug Interface```.
	5. Select the box next to ```CC3200``` to add a check mark.
	6. Click the ```Save``` button to the right.
	7. Back in the ```Target Configurations``` panel to the right, expand ```User Defined```.
	8. Right click on your new target configuration and select ```Set as Default```.

3. 	Execute the example on the CC3200 device
	1. connect the device to your PC or Mac with USB cable
	2. hit the green bug button on the top in the CCS, or select ```Run``` ->```Debug```

This should upload your program to RAM and end up with a debugger standing at the first line of main function in main.c.

Reaching this point means you are able to produce and execute CC3200 compatible binary on the device itself.  Congratulations!

**NOTE**: As per Texas Instruments instructions, keep the J15 Jumper set to ON and push Reset button on the board before each debug session. In case of trouble get help from [TI's CC3200 help doc](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc3200.pdf)

### Adding the Xively Client to ent_wlan

- locate the successful wifi connection point in the main.c of the ent_wlan example (arond line 647, comment: "//wait for few moments")
- here put a call on the  ConnectToXively(); function. Its implementation is based on the examples in the Client repo, e.g. xively-client-c/examples/mqtt_logic_producer/src/mqtt_logic_producer.c:

        #include <xively.h>
        #include <stdio.h>

        void on_connection_state_changed( xi_context_handle_t in_context_handle,
                                          void* data,
                                          xi_state_t state )
        {
            printf( "Hello Xively World!, state: %d\n", state );
        }

        void ConnectToXively()
        {
            xi_initialize( "xi_account_id", "xi_device_id", 0 );

            xi_context_handle_t xi_context = xi_create_context();

            if ( XI_INVALID_CONTEXT_HANDLE >= xi_context )
            {
                printf( " xi failed to create context, error: %d\n", xi_context );
            }

            xi_state_t connect_result = xi_connect(
                    xi_context,
                    "35f9a1ba-2f71-4084-9b68-995eac71ef6b",         // Xively Username
                    "9Xusd8+jjTghQcggpvEPhu5AFY1GlVnuV9WYwxp8ZT8=", // Xively Password
                    10, 20,
                    XI_SESSION_CLEAN, &on_connection_state_changed );

            xi_events_process_blocking();

            xi_delete_context( xi_context );

            xi_shutdown();
        }

- to make aboves buildable you'll need to
    - add two include paths to your project to help compiler find xively.h and friends: ```Project```->```Properties```->```Build```->```ARM Compiler```->```Include Options```:
        - xively-client-c/include
        - xively-client-c/include/bsp
    - add two libraries Xively C Client and wolfSSL: ```Project```->```Properties```->```Build```->```ARM Linker```->```File Search Path```:
        - xively-client-c/bin/cc3200/libxively.a
        - xively-client-c/src/import/tls/wolfssl/tirtos/packages/ti/net/wolfssl/lib/wolfssl.aem4f
    - add two files timer_if.h and timer_if.c to the project: ```Project```->```Add Files```: ti/tirex-content/CC3200SDK_1.1.0/cc3200-sdk/example/common
    - implement two functions as follows:

            #include <time.h>
            #include <xi_bsp_rng.h>
            #include <xi_bsp_time.h>

            time_t XTIME(time_t * timer)
            {
                return xi_bsp_time_getcurrenttime_seconds();
            }

            uint32_t xively_ssl_rand_generate()
            {
                return xi_bsp_rng_get();
            }

    - update the memory map in file cc3200v1p32.cmd. This should do it:

            MEMORY
            {
                /* Application uses internal RAM for program and data */
                SRAM_CODE (RWX) : origin = 0x20004000, length = 0x3C000
                //SRAM_DATA (RWX) : origin = 0x20017000, length = 0x19000
            }

            /* Section allocation in memory */

            SECTIONS
            {
                .intvecs:   > RAM_BASE
                .init_array : > SRAM_CODE
                .vtable :   > SRAM_CODE
                .text   :   > SRAM_CODE
                .const  :   > SRAM_CODE
                .cinit  :   > SRAM_CODE
                .pinit  :   > SRAM_CODE
                .data   :   > SRAM_CODE
                .bss    :   > SRAM_CODE
                .sysmem :   > SRAM_CODE
                .stack  :   > SRAM_CODE(HIGH)
            }

    - update wifi settings in main.c

        - update AP name and password defines according to your wifi settings:

                #define ENT_NAME    "AccessPointName"
                #define USER_NAME   "UsernameIfAny"
                #define PASSWORD    "Password"

        - select security type in EntWlan() function according to your wifi settings, in case of WPA2 set

                g_SecParams.Type = SL_SEC_TYPE_WPA_WPA2;

            and delete variable eapParams and pass NULL as last attribute to connect function:

                lRetVal = sl_WlanConnect(ENT_NAME,strlen(ENT_NAME),NULL,&g_SecParams,NULL);

    - all set: ```Project```->```Build``` and ```Run```->```Debug```

        This should result in a CC3200 connected to Xively Services.
